# Message Frequency Count
# By: Kaitlyn Weiler

# Open the desired file and create a handle
handle = open('mbox.txt')

# Establish a dictionary which will contain the number of messages
# from each person:
counts = {}

# A loop that, for each line in the handle that starts with "From "
# will strip the line into elements, take the first element as "senders"
# and adds the senders, along with their counts, to the dictionary.
for line in handle:
    if line.startswith('From '):
        words = line.split()
        sender = words[1]
        counts[sender] = counts.get(sender,0) + 1

# Create a list of tuples (count, sender) from the dictionary and sort
# the list in decending (highest to lowest) order:
tlist = sorted([(count,sender) for sender,count in counts.items()], \
reverse=True)

# Print the result statement:
for count,sender in tlist[:1]:
    print('The person with the highest number of sent messages is', \
    sender, 'with', count, 'messages.')
