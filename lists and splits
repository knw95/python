# Lists and Split
# By: Kaitlyn Weiler

# Prompts the user for a file and opens the file:
file_name = input('Enter file name: ')
file_hand = open(file_name)

# Creates an empty list:
script_list = list()

# For each line in the open file, split the line into words:
for line in file_hand: 
    file_word_list = line.split()
    # For each word in the list of words, convert to lowercase, and if not in list, add to end of the list:
    for word in file_word_list:
        low_word = word.lower()
        if not low_word in script_list: script_list.append(low_word)

# Takes the list and sorts the items inside alphabetically:
script_list.sort()

# print(script_list) # Use to check the list.
# for word in script_list: print(word) # Use to check each word, one at a time

# Create a new list called word_list which is identical to script_list:
word_list = script_list

# Define a function called freq_count() to count the freqeuncey of an item in each element:
def freq_count(search_str, word_list):
	# For each element, or word, in the script list, start the frequency count at '0'
    for word in word_list:
        count = 0
        # This variable 'spot' keeps track of the position within the word
        spot = word.find(search_str)
        while spot >= 0:
			# When the 'search_str' target occurs within the word, the count is increased.
            count += 1
			# The position then changes to skip the last occurence and search for the next.
            spot += len(search_str)
            spot = word.find(search_str, spot)
			# If no occurence is found, the 'while' loop ends and proceeds to the next word.
        print(word, '-', count)

# Prompt the user for a substring to query:
search_str = input('Enter substring: ')

# Pass the list into the function:
freq_count(search_str, word_list)
