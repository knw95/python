# Process Numbers
# By: Kaitlyn Weiler

# Part 1: process_numbers.py

# Write a program called “process_numbers.py” that repeatedly reads floating point numbers 
# input by the user until the user types “done”. After the user has entered “done”, print out 
# (i.e. print) the total, count, maximum, minimum, and average of the entered numbers:

count = 0
total = 0
max = None
min = None

while True:
    num = input('Enter a number below. Enter "done" when finished.\n> ')
    if num == 'done': break
    try: 
        flnum = float(num)
        count += float(1)
        total += flnum
        if max is None or flnum > max: max = flnum
        if min is None or flnum < min: min = flnum
    except: print('Invalid input')

print('The count is', count, '\nThe total is', total, \
'\nThe average is', total/count, '\nThe maximum is', max, '\nThe minimum is', min)
